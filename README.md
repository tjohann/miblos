My simple bare-metal os (MIBLOS)
================================


This repository provides a basic playground for the bare-metal realtime topics which should end in an simple realtime os for avr controller.

In the future cortex-M3 (https://github.com/tjohann/arm_cortex_sdk) controller and jailhouse bare-metal hypervisor cell will follow.

Micheal J. Pont (http://www.safetty.net/about) describes in his book ERES (http://www.safetty.net/publications/the-engineering-of-reliable-embedded-systems) a time triggert os/system/environment to build reliable embedded systems. This book is something like a guideline for me.

WARNING: This is work in progress! So it's possible that something is not working or possibly not implemented yet. If you face a bug then pls use create an issue (https://github.com/tjohann/miblos/issues).
