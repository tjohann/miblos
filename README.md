My simple bare-metal os (MIBLOS)
================================


This repository provides a basic playground for the bare-metal realtime topics which should end in an simple realtime os for avr, cortex-M3 (https://github.com/tjohann/arm_cortex_sdk) controller and jailhouse bare-metal hypervisor cell.

Micheal J. Pont (http://www.safetty.net/about) describes in his book ERES (http://www.safetty.net/publications/the-engineering-of-reliable-embedded-systems) a time triggert os/system/environment to build reliable embedded systems. This book is somthing like a guideline for me.
